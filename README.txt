This is a model of Charlie Parker's solos over Perhaps. 

First, his solo is inputted into NetworkX to create a network of his notes over certain chords. Based on this information, a walk is performed over the network of chords and notes to create a new Parkeresque solo. The Python Notebook has documentation throughout to explain the process of creating the new solo. misicpy is used to listen to the solos.
